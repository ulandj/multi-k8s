The status should eventually return with a green checkmark and show "build passing"

Go to your AWS Elasticbeanstalk application

It should say "Elastic Beanstalk is updating your environment"

It should eventually show a green checkmark under "Health". You will now be able to access your application at the external URL provided under the environment name.
